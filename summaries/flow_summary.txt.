Flow is a fast, decentralized blockchain designed specifically for digital assets and next-generation applications. Created by Dapper Labs (the team behind CryptoKitties), Flow was built to address the scalability limitations of earlier blockchains while maintaining decentralization and security.
Key Features

Multi-role Architecture: Unlike many blockchains, Flow separates consensus, computation, storage, and verification into specialized node roles, enabling high throughput without sharding.
Smart Contracts with Cadence: Flow introduces Cadence, a resource-oriented programming language designed to be secure and developer-friendly for building digital assets and dApps.
Resource-Oriented Programming: Digital assets on Flow are modeled as resources with clear ownership rules, making them more intuitive to work with.
Developer Experience: Flow prioritizes tooling and developer experience, with multiple SDKs and frameworks for easier onboarding.
Upgradeable Smart Contracts: Supports contract upgradeability without compromising security, enabling smoother evolution of applications.

Prominent Use Cases

NBA Top Shot: The hugely successful digital collectibles platform for basketball highlights and moments.
Gaming & NFTs: Optimized for NFTs, games, and interactive experiences.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Supporting a growing ecosystem of financial applications.

The FLOW token serves as the native currency for the network, used for staking, fees, and rewards within the ecosystem.
