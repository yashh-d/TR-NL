# Avalanche Network: Core Mission and Features

## Mission Statement
Avalanche aims to provide a unified platform for creating, transferring, and trading digital assets through a secure, scalable, and decentralized infrastructure.

## Basic Overview
Avalanche is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract platform launched in September 2020. It uses a novel consensus mechanism called "Avalanche consensus" and features a multichain architecture with three primary chains (P, X, and C chains), each serving distinct purposes within the ecosystem.

## Key Features

### Scalability
- Designed to support high transaction throughput
- Capable of handling a global network with millions of connected devices
- Optimized for low latency operations

### Security
- Configurable security thresholds
- Graceful degradation when facing attacks
- Can maintain safety guarantees even when attack thresholds exceed 51%

### Decentralization
- No distinction between miners, developers, and users
- Multiple client implementations
- No centralized control mechanisms

### Governance
- Token holders ($AVAX) can participate in validation and governance
- Democratic voting on key financial parameters
- Community input on system evolution

### Interoperability
- Supports multiple blockchains/assets
- Designed for easy porting of existing blockchains
- Compatible with multiple scripting languages and virtual machines

## Subnets
Subnets are subsets of validators that can run their own virtual machines with custom rules. Benefits include:
- Creating application-specific blockchains
- Supporting both private (permissioned) and public (permissionless) deployments
- Isolating high-traffic applications from congesting the main network
- Enabling specialized properties for reliability, efficiency, and data sovereignty

## Native Token
The platform's native token is called $AVAX. It serves as:
- A unit of account for exchange
- A security mechanism for the network
- A means of participation in governance

## Technical Naming
- The platform name is Avalanche
- The consensus protocol family is called Snow*
- Specific protocol instantiations are Avalanche, Snowman, and Frosty
