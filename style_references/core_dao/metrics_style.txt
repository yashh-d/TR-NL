ðŸ”¸What weâ€™re watching: The Core DAO governance team proposed an increase in validator bond requirements, which increases the amount of CORE tokens needed 4,900% from 10,000 to 500,000.

ðŸ”¸Why it matters: This proposal looks to enhance the networkâ€™s security and accountability by increasing the threshold needed to participate in Coreâ€™s proof-of-stake (PoS) network. Existing validators will be grandfathered in, while new validators and any partners will need to meet the updated threshold, the proposal stated. In turn, it's designed to make the blockchain a more robust and committed validator ecosystem.

For context, validators are an integral part of PoS networks because they help maintain the blockchainâ€™s integrity and functionality. With the current validator threshold at 10,000 CORE, it allows a broad range of participants to join the ecosystem and contribute to its decentralization.

However, this low amount can also attract bad actors that donâ€™t have the networkâ€™s security in best interest, as well as influence voting decisions and staking amounts. By increasing the amount needed by a significant percentage, it can be seen as a strategic move to deter malicious users and enhance network reliability. 

Currently, 500,000 CORE tokens is equivalent to about $221,800. As opposed to the current amount needed, which is about $4,436, it means there is more capital needed to participate, thus making a higher barrier of entry.  

ðŸ”¸The bigger picture: The proposed change aims to position the Core blockchain as a network built for scalability and long term token holders. A 500,000 CORE validator threshold could incentivize those who prioritize the health of its network.

Over time, this could elevate Coreâ€™s reputation as a secure and stable blockchain, potentially attracting developers and institutional users alike.
