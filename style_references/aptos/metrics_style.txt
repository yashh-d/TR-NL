🌐What happened: Aptos stablecoin market cap hit $615 million on Dec. 18, up nearly 100% on the week, DefiLlama data shows.

🌐Why does it matter: Stablecoins have grown in popularity across the entire crypto sector and show strong growth on the Aptos network. 

Earlier this year, Tether (USDT) launched its stablecoin to the Aptos network. This brought the biggest stablecoin by market cap to the Move-powered blockchain, broadening the reach for accessible, dollar-backed digital assets. At the time, when Tether was first launched, the stablecoin market cap was just $273 million. Since then, it has grown more than 125%, proving that there is product-market fit for stablecoins on Aptos.

For additional reference, natively-minted USDT supply on Aptos went from $130 million to $340 million during December, Token Terminal reported. This metric is important because it shows the popularity of stablecoin usage on the network. 

Aptos is optimized for scalable, secure and interoperable stablecoin usage, making it a promising landing zone to set a foundation for stablecoin dominance. This in turn could pave the way for future DeFi innovations on Aptos and encourage builders and users looking for a strong stablecoin market. 

🌐The big picture: As stablecoins like USDT gain traction, its usage on the Aptos network directly aligns with a mission to provide solutions for various DeFi needs. This can lead to larger-scale adoption and developer engagement across multiple financial applications.
