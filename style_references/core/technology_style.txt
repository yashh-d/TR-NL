ðŸ”¸What weâ€™re watching: Core announced the launch of its Fusion Upgrade, a network change that brings Dual Staking and Liquid Bitcoin Staking (LstBTC) to the blockchain. 

ðŸ”¸Why it matters: The Fusion Upgrade is the networkâ€™s next step to strengthen Coreâ€™s alignment with the Bitcoin  ecosystem by incentivizing participation across both networks. 

Dual Staking utilizes a tiered reward structure where users can select where they earn yield based on their network preference. This system would ensure network sustainability without inflating the rewards pool. In addition, it can expand the utility of the CORE token by positioning it as the main driver for users who want to maximize their staking yield. 

The LstBTC token, set to go live soon, encourages stakers to participate in the broader Coreâ€™s ecosystem without compromising ownership of their assets. This means users can retain the amount of liquidity they control, thus making bitcoin staking more versatile and accessible. This is one of Coreâ€™s mission statements as they want to provide users the ability to earn yield on their holdings, but still be exposed to bitcoinâ€™s upside potential.

With the addition of these two functions, Core aims to create more attention for Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi). As Bitcoin becomes more popular, users may be attracted to the BTCfi space because of the yield-generating solutions Core offers.

ðŸ”¸The bigger picture: The Fusion Upgrade can be a secure environment for users who want to earn yield on their bitcoin. In terms of market share, Core is number one for networks focused on helping scale bitcoin, across multiple key metrics and categories like TVL and DeFi protocols created onchain, according to data presented by Footprint Analytics. 

Core looks to increase this percentage by aligning the Bitcoin network with its own network so users can engage with both chainâ€™s assets. The network also wants to drive growth in scaling and cater to both institutional and individual participants.
