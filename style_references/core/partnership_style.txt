ðŸ”¸What weâ€™re watching: Core partnered with Singapore-based custody and wallet infrastructure provider Cobo to integrate its liquid-staking token, lstBTC.

ðŸ”¸Why it matters: Cobo serves institutional clients in financial hubs across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. By integration lstBTC into its services, Core can expand its digital footprint into a previously untapped region. This aligns with the networkâ€™s goal to offer global accessibility and secure investment avenue for institutions that want to earn yield on their bitcoin.

Since Cobo has regulatory-compliant custody solutions in place, this provides an additional avenue for institutional investors to engage with bitcoin staking in a way that aligns with security and risk management best practices. In turn, it could unlock liquidity within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and reinforce bitcoinâ€™s role beyond a store of value and positioning it as an active asset within institutional portfolios.

Core has established partnerships with numerous institutions, but the collaboration with Cobo stands out because of its expansion to Asia. 

Since Asia is one of the fastest-growing markets for digital assets (expected to hit $2.16 trillion by 2030), Coboâ€™s presence could provide Core with a gateway to institutional clients, a part of an emerging financial economy.

ðŸ”¸The bigger picture: This partnership reinforces Coreâ€™s position in globally-accessible bitcoin staking solutions by aligning with a custody provider that institutions engage with. 

Unlike partnerships that focus on ecosystem growth or technology integrations, this collaboration aims to be a direct bridge between bitcoin staking and institutional capital. 

With growing interest in bitcoin yield strategies, having Cobo within Coreâ€™s portfolio of partnerships might turn the tide for regulated entities who are still on edge about engaging with DeFi.
