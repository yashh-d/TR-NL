🔥What we’re watching: Tokenization is a hot topic across web3, but the opportunity to tokenize fan experiences has just begun, according to panelists on Token Relations quarterly webinar with Matchain.  

🔥Why it matters: In recent months, Matchain joined forces with Paris Saint-Germain F.C. to bring its fans onchain through web3 experiences, alongside its Joint Innovation Studio (JIS). 

“It's not just about partnerships, but unlocking solutions and benefits,” Petrix Barbosa, CEO of Matchain said on the webinar. “Once we see the benefits unlocked to fans it can be replicated anywhere.”

When it comes to tokenization of fans, they are a representation of “something that is valuable,”  PSG’s Head of PSG Labs Pär Helgosson said on the call. That value is more effective when it's captured, analyzed and “managed.”

“When it comes to fan data, consumption and merchandise — it will be tokenized,” Helgosson added. “We believe that as a club as well.”

The adoption of web3 technology won’t happen overnight, Helgosson noted. “If you look at our 100s of millions of fans, they need to be engaged and captured where they're at. Not everyone is going to pour into web3 this year or next, it will take time."

But as the maturity of fans and its ecosystem increases, so will the level of tokenization, Helgosson and Barbosa concurred. 

As of today, fan data is siloed and hard to track, Helgosson noted. But once its tokenized and decentralized identities (DIDs)  are accounted for, clubs like PSG can start rewarding accounts based on behavior and consumption, he added. 

“All of our collectibles moving forward will be tokenized, fungible or not,” Helgosson said. Soon PSG’s partnerships and sponsors will also think about tokenizing assets, too, he added. 

"Sometimes we get lost in [whether] it's about web3 versus it's about the fan,” Helgosson said. “In our world, it's about the fan. It's about providing cool, lovely, easy to use [apps] versus what hasn't been reached before.”

🔥The bigger picture: PSG has a global audience with about 92% of its fans outside of its homebase of France and about 82% under 34 years old, Helgosson said. 

By integrating with Matchain and blockchain technology, this can create experiences that help connect fans around the world. It can also reward the loyalty and support to those that interact digitally as well as in person. Matchain can help to facilitate these tokenized experiences across a variety of sectors and areas, with entertainment and brands like PSG at the forefront. 

"Groups with major fan bases need to start thinking about [integrating] blockchains," Barbosa said. "It's inevitable."
